 To gather insights and look at the feature importance of each feature contributing towards the target variable. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.


### Learnings from the project

 * How are the features important to our model.
* How to select the most significant features out of many.
* How to perform univariate feature selection.
* How to perform a multivariate feature selection.
